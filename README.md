For using the code in this repository first of all you need to install XAMPP in your system and then start the Apache server and the MySQL server.Then you need to open ```localhost/phpmyadmin``` then you need to create a database and then a table over there and then add the coloumns to the table.

After creating the table you can look up the code in your favourite text editors and you can add different stylings and content to the page I added basic styling and contents to the page.
